Part-1:
a) Plotting the Total Energy Consumed by the Residential Sector per month.
b) Aggregated the data above into yearly values, and plotted the yearly values 


Part 2:
a) Loaded the wine dataset from sklearn library.
b) Applying the MinMaxScaler() from the sklearn preprocessing library to the wine data to normalize it. 
c) Applying the StandardScaler() from the sklearn preprocessing library to the wine data to standardize it.
d) Applying the PCA library to the standardized data from c) and determine the number of dimensions that can be reduced while capturing 90% of the variance in the data.
